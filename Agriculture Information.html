In India, the earliest records date from about 4,000 BC at Atranjikhera in Uttar Pradesh. Carbonized seeds of Chickpea that have been unearthed in various archaeological sites throughout the Middle-East indicate the use of this legume already in the Neolithic period together with the cereals wheat and barley and the pulses pea and lentil. The species has also been introduced into parts of America, Australia and Africa, but it has not achieved much importance outside its original area of distribution.</p>
